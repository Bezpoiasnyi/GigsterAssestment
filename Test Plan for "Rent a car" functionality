Note: Change in Testing Platform
Due to the "Rent a Car" functionality no longer being available on Lyft's platform, the test scenarios have been adjusted to evaluate the equivalent feature on Uber's platform instead.

High-Level Test Plan for "Rent a Car" Functionality

Introduction
This test plan outlines how we will test the "Rent a Car" feature on the Uber mobile website to ensure it works correctly and meets user needs.

Objectives
Our main goals are to:
Confirm that users can successfully book rental cars without any issues.
Check that the system is easy to use and performs well.

Scope
We will focus on:
Making sure the booking form works as expected.
Checking that all required fields are validated properly.
Testing across different web browsers and mobile devices.

Test Approach
We will manually test the website to see how it responds to user actions and input.
